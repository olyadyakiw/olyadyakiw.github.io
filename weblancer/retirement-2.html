                           A friend recently told me he’s planning to retire but is worried about his financial ability
                           to do so. When he described his situation, I told him it seemed to me he didn’t have anything
                           to worry about. But, still he’s worried. As luck would have it, I heard a finance professor
                           lecture on retirement income planning the following day. He suggested a strategy that might
                           just help put my friend’s mind at ease. I then also read an article in the Harvard Business
                           Review by Nobel laureate economist Robert Merton touting the same idea. It’s not a cure-all,
                           a panacea or magical solution. As a financial whiz-kid once reminded me, “No financial
                           product has a ‘secret sauce’.”

                              <span class="article__subtitle">The concept: </span> use annuities as a key element in
                              your
                              retirement income strategy.
                           </p>
                           <p>

                              My friend’s situation: A debt-free widower in his late 50s, Dave will be retiring from his
                              firm at age 60. He’ll receive a five year buy-out of his stock at retirement, has a
                              sizeable
                              401(k) and has built up a comfortable nest egg of savings. The problem — he’s so used to
                              making a healthy income from working all these years that he’s uncomfortable with the idea
                              of
                              spending down his assets to pay for his retirement. Dave’s problem is not that he has a
                              tangible lack of wealth, but that he has the intangible fear of outliving his assets.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              The reason the finance professor’s lecture hit home for me is he focused on the idea that
                              people are far more comfortable with a retirement strategy of spending their income than
                              spending their assets. To make his point, he referenced the problems with the “4 ½ Percent
                              Rule” that some planners use as a retirement income approach. This rule of thumb suggests
                              that a couple can annually withdraw 4.5% of their retirement capital, adjusting the
                              withdrawal rate upward each year for inflation, with little fear of outliving their
                              income.
                              The professor pointed out that for some retirees this approach raises the fear, “What
                              happens
                              if I don’t make enough on my portfolio to justify this income; will I outlive my assets?”
                              For
                              others, it engenders the opposite emotion: “What if my assets do better than this; will I
                              have been too conservative, and robbed myself of a happy retirement while leaving more
                              than I
                              intended to my kids?” <br>
                              An annuity strategy addresses both of these fears.

                           </p>

                        <div class="article__item-2">
                           <div class="article__subtitle">The Strategy</div>
                           <p>
                              Although these concerns are more rooted in emotions than numbers, the simple fact is a
                              worried retiree is not a happy retiree. The professor’s suggested strategy is to convert
                              assets into guaranteed income. His point is that people are far more comfortable living
                              within a known income stream than they are spending down assets for an unknown period of
                              time. Thus, he suggests a prospective or current retiree take a portion of retirement
                              assets and purchase a fixed annuity income stream. The annuity income can begin
                              immediately or it can be deferred until a later age. It can pay an income for life, for a
                              period of years or for the greater of life and a guaranteed period of years.
                              This idea isn’t just an academic construct, but a realistic financial tactic. Commercial
                              annuities offer a number of flexible features and options that come in handy in crafting a
                              retirement income strategy with peace of mind. Consider my friend Dave’s situation and see
                              where annuities might help him.

                           <span class="article__subtitle">1. Ladder the purchase of annuities: </span>
                           Similar to a bond laddering strategy, the idea would be to
                           invest in annuities that begin and end at different times. Start with laddering the purchase
                           of
                           annuities. Dave has a few years until he retires. When he retires at age 60, he will largely
                           continue his current stream of income until he reaches 65 — the age at which the payments on
                           his
                           equity interest in the firm cease. Particularly since we are in a low interest rate
                           environment,
                           Dave might consider investing in a deferred annuity, where each year he deposits dollars to
                           build up tax- deferred retirement capital; wealth he can then convert into an income at age
                           65.
                           Although he can buy a new annuity each year, he doesn’t necessarily need to since a deferred
                           annuity typically credits interest at current rates. And, deferred annuities have options as
                           to
                           how the money will eventually be distributed. Dave annually deposits money into his deferred
                           annuity, and then at age 65 he could either take a fixed payout for life or withdraw a
                           percentage of his annuity each year. This strategy gives him peace of mind that he’s
                           replacing
                           the income he loses when his buy-out is completed, yet gives him options as to how and when
                           he
                           receives income thereafter.

                        <p>
                           <span class="article__subtitle">2. Ladder the payout of annuities:</span>
                           A different laddering strategy would be to target multiple
                           payout periods. My friend is very active and wants to enjoy the “go-go” period of his
                           retirement before it becomes a “slow-go”. He could take some of his capital and buy an
                           annuity that pays out a significant income from 65 to 75, his hoped for “go- go” years. He
                           could then buy a different annuity that doesn’t begin payouts until age 75, and is designed
                           to pay out for the remainder of his life. This provides him with a higher income during his
                           active years; and, then an income, albeit smaller, that he can’t outlive in his later years.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <span class="article__subtitle">3. Annuities as a health care safety net:</span>
                           One of Dave’s concerns is the increasing cost of
                           health care and the staggering cost of long-term care facilities. Annuities aren’t designed
                           to replace Medigap and long-term care insurance, but they can provide an affluent retiree
                           with a safety net. Even though Dave has a significant retirement fund built up, he is
                           especially worried about having enough money for health costs in his later years when he
                           might be committed to a long- term care facility. An annuity can provide an income
                           supplement. One form of an annuity may be particularly helpful: a deferred income annuity.
                           Consumers are generally familiar with deferred annuities, where they put money away now in
                           order to take out an income in the future (the approach discussed above). These products
                           typically credit current market rates, are flexible as to when they are annuitized and offer
                           the ability to be surrendered. Not as many people are familiar with deferred income
                           annuities. With this policy form, you put away money now and will receive a fixed income for
                           a predetermined period of years at a designated future date. Because the owner can’t
                           surrender or commute the annuity, the insurer is able to pay a higher income in the future.
                           Dave might peel off $100,000 of his retirement capital today to receive a guaranteed lifetime
                           income in the range of $30,000 when he attains age 80. This income would be there to provide
                           a safety net in case he has unexpected health care costs, or should Social Security and
                           Medicare fail to perform as planned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <span class="article__subtitle">4. Convert an asset into an annuity:</span>
                           The decision to purchase an annuity doesn’t exist in a vacuum. People near retirement
                           typically have a number of financial assets at their disposal which can be turned into a
                           stream of annuity payments. For example, Dave’s401(k) can be paid out in the form of an
                           annuity for life. In fact, on July 1 the Treasury issued final regulations amending required
                           minimum distribution rules to allow annuity investors to start collecting later. Even the IRS
                           recognizes the retirement income value of this strategy. Dave also has a cash value life
                           insurance policy. If he feels he no longer needs the death benefit of the policy, he can
                           exchange the policy tax-free for an annuity. Likewise, he can convert his Roth IRA into a
                           guaranteed stream of tax-free payments for life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           The sole aim of a retirement income strategy cannot be simply to maximize retirement income.
                           There are too many variables to even accurately make this calculation, and how will you ever
                           know if you succeeded? As my friend Dave’s situation makes clear, intangible concerns such as
                           peace-of-mind must also factor into the planning. There is no one approach that solves this
                           dilemma, but the use of annuities in retirement income planning is a strategy worth
                           considering.

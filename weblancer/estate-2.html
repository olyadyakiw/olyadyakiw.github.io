                        </p>
                        <p>
                           An estate tax is the amount of taxes owed to the federal government upon your death. Your
                           family’s tax liability will depend on two things:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>1. How much your estate is worth</li>
                           <li>2. How much estate planning you accomplished during your lifetime</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                           No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones with a heavy tax burden, which is why it
                           is
                           so important to speak with your certified financial planner to begin the planning of your
                           estate
                           as soon as possible. Even if you don’t think that you have a large number of assets, you
                           would
                           be surprised at the amount that the value of your cars, stocks, bonds, property, retirement
                           accounts, etc. will total once your financial planner calculates it for you. Fortunately,
                           there
                           are several ways to avoid estate taxes, and this article will discuss some of the options
                           available to you.

                           <p>
                              You are allowed to give up to $11,000 per calendar year without paying gift tax to
                              whomever you
                              choose. This includes donations to charities, paying for someone’s tuition or medical
                              bills,
                              contributing to a college savings 529 account, etc. This type of gift reduces your estate
                              and,
                              subsequently, the estate taxes to be assessed.

                              Avoiding Estate Tax Using a Revocable Living Trust with an AB Provision
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              With this type of trust, as spouse leaves up the exemption amount of their property in an
                              irrevocable trust for the surviving spouse and children, and the surviving spouse has the
                              right
                              to use the funds when needed. This can make a dramatic difference in the amount of estate
                              tax
                              owed when the second spouse dies, because the exemption amount of both the first and
                              second
                              spouse are used instead of just that of the last spouse to die. The AB trust is usually
                              established using a Revocable Living Trust. It should be noted, however, that this marital
                              deduction may not apply in cases where the spouse is a U.S. citizen, even if they are a
                              legal
                              resident. In this case, proper wording of your will is necessary in order to prevent your
                              spouse
                              from being responsible for paying estate tax.

                              These trusts enable couples to avoid further problems that can arise when one spouse
                              passes away
                              and the surviving spouse automatically inherits the estate. These types of trusts, like
                              most
                              others, are subject to regulations that vary by state, so you should ask your financial

                           <p>
                              These types of trusts involve making a sizeable gift to a foundation, and in some cases,
                              establishing a private foundation in your name, or a beneficiary’s name of your choosing.
                              An Irrevocable Personal Residence Trust: This type of trust is an excellent estate
                              planning tool
                              for larger estates, especially those that include a house that has appreciated
                              significantly in
                              value. As owner of the residence, you can place your house into the personal residence
                              trust
                              during your lifetime, but your beneficiaries must wait a certain number of years before
                              they
                              receive the house. Through the personal residence trust, you remove a substantial asset
                              (namely:
                              your house) from the estate, but will be assessed a gift tax on only a portion of the
                              value of
                              the asset, securing a savings of many thousands of dollars.

                              An Irrevocable Grantor Retained Annuity Trust:
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              This trust works on the same principle as the personal residence trust, except that it is
                              designed for assets other than a house. They work very well for any asset that has
                              appreciated
                              or is appreciating in value. For example as shareholder, you could place your stock into
                              this
                              type of trust for a term of ten years, with your children as beneficiaries. This gift
                              savings
                              tax would be similar to those achieved through a personal residence trust.
                           </p>
                        </div>

                        This type of trust is useful for an appreciated asset that is not producing much income. For
                        example, you may decide to give your vacation home to your favorite charity using a charitable
                        remainder trust. Since charities are exempt from capital gains tax, the charity can sell the
                        home for its fair market value and invest the entire proceeds according the provisions of the
                        trust. You would receive a fixed dollar amount every year, at the rate of five percent or more
                        of the value of the trust, and assuming the principal is invested well, when you die the
                        original principal will remain and will be owned by the charity. This give s you the
                        satisfaction of knowing that you have made an important gift to a charity, have established an
                        income for yourself for the rest of your life, and have arranged for a substantial deduction on
                        the amount of estate tax due from your estate when you die. The financial decisions that you
                        make today can impact the financial well being of your family for generations to come, which is
                        why it is so important to begin planning your estate as soon as possible, if you haven’t
                        already. Contact your financial advisor for more information and for advice on all types of
                        financial and estate planning topics.

                           Annuities have a great allure, furnishing you income in retirement. But there are annuities
                           and
                           there are annuities. And they are dauntingly complex. One very smart advisor who can untangle
                           them is Jeff Rose, CFP, the founder of Alliance Wealth Management in Carbondale, Ill His
                           take:
                           Annuities, like any other investment, make perfect sense in the right situation. In the wrong
                           situation, they can cost you money – and even be dangerous.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Here’s what you need to know.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article__subtitle">
                           1. How long is the term?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           The term depends on the type of annuity you choose and the payout period you require.
                           If you choose an immediate annuity, you fund the plan with an upfront lump sum investment and
                           can begin receiving income payments immediately. Under a deferred annuity, you fund the plan
                           over a number of years – typically the difference between your current age and projected
                           retirement age – and begin taking income payments at the end of the specified term.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Beyond funding, your income payments can last as long as you choose. Three principal types of
                           income payment plans are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                              • Lifetime payments that guarantee you an income during your lifetime but provide no
                              benefits to
                              your survivors after your death.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              • Income for a guaranteed period under which you receive payments. If you die before the
                              end of
                              the term, the benefit payments continue to your survivors until the end of term.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              • Income for life with a guaranteed period benefit combines elements of both the above
                              plans.
                              You can receive an income for a specified term and payments continue to your survivors
                              until the
                              end of the term if you die before the term ends. If you live beyond the term, the plan
                              pays you
                              an income for the rest of your life.

                           2. What is a typical surrender charge?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Annuities typically come with surrender charges, the amount of which depends on the insurance
                           company you buy the annuity through, as well when you begin to withdraw funds. These charges
                           resemble redemption fees that some mutual fund companies charge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Surrender charges can be as high as 8% to 10% of the value of the annuity. Insurers typically
                           assess one if you begin withdrawing money from the annuity during the first few years after
                           you
                           establish the plan. These charges also tend to work on a sliding scale, with the highest
                           charge
                           occurring during the first year of redemption.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Eventually, the surrender charge either drops to a much smaller level or disappears
                           completely.
                           Most annuities do provide a free withdrawal: Typically you can withdraw 10% of your principal
                           plus interest. Once again, read the fine print. Some annuities also allow a 10% free
                           withdrawal
                           in the first year; others make you wait at least one year.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article__subtitle"> 3. Did the advisor recommending the annuity really do the
                           homework?</p>
                        <p>
                           Your financial advisor must know a great deal about your situation and future plans – and
                           what
                           aspect of those plans you hope to cover with an annuity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           The advisor needs to know (and ask):
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>• Are you looking primarily for income for yourself?</li>
                           <li>• Do you want to provide for survivors?</li>
                           <li>• What’s your investment risk tolerance?</li>
                           <li>• What are your other investment assets?</li>
                           <li>• What other income sources will you have?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                           If the advisor merely puts you in some general annuity that doesn’t end up taking all your
                           needs
                           into account, be suspicious. Annuities contain a host of options and variables; your advisor,
                           if
                           good, can construct a plan right for you. Many advisors claim independence but in fact
                           represent
                           – and cash commission checks from – only a few annuity providers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article__subtitle">
                           4. Do you understand your annuity’s parts?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Annuities are investment contracts complete with various provisions. In addition to
                           understanding income options and payout terms, you need to understand the good and bad of
                           various types of annuities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           For example, with a fixed annuity the insurance company pays a fixed rate of interest for a
                           specific time, much like a certificate of deposit. A variable annuity includes sub-accounts
                           that
                           function like mutual funds and often provides a higher rate of return than fixed annuities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Still another option: indexed annuities that tie performance to an equity-based index, much
                           the
                           same way index mutual funds function. An indexed annuity often comes with a guaranteed
                           minimum
                           return to limit your risk of loss if the index does poorly. Always ask your advisor to
                           explain
                           any points.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article__subtitle">
                           5. Is your annuity guaranteed?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           You risk losing some of your investment – comparable to your risk when you invest in other
                           assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds – as no federal agency
                           comparable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) ensures your principal.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           In most states, though, guaranty associations do provide coverage of up to $100,000, similar
                           to
                           the Securities Investors Protection Corp. (SIPC) to protect you if the insurance company
                           defaults. Unlike SIPC, the guaranty association is not a government-sponsored organization
                           but
                           an industry arrangement from various insurers operating in a given state.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Check your insurer through a third-party source such as A.M. Best, a respected rating agency
                           in
                           regard to insurance companies. The strength of the insurer issuing your annuity is your
                           first,
                           best protection.
